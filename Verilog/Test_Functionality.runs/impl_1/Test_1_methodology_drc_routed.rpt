2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ON_OFF/out_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[0] relative to clock(s) sysclk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[1] relative to clock(s) sysclk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[2] relative to clock(s) sysclk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[3] relative to clock(s) sysclk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to clock(s) sysclk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch COUNT/out1_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin COUNT/out1_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch COUNT/out2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin COUNT/out2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on sysclk_n overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
